                <p class="text-lg">Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the site owners. Cookies typically contain the name of the website they come from, how long they will remain on your device, and a unique identifier. They help websites remember your preferences and improve your user experience. Without cookies, some website functionality may be impaired.</p>

                <p class="text-lg">We use several types of cookies on our Site: Strictly Necessary Cookies (essential for site operation), Performance Cookies (collect anonymous data about site usage), Functionality Cookies (remember your preferences), and Targeting/Advertising Cookies (used for personalized advertising). Each type serves a different purpose and helps us provide a better user experience. Some cookies are session-based and expire when you close your browser, while others are persistent and remain on your device for a set period.</p>

                <p class="text-lg">These essential cookies enable core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility. They are necessary for the website to function properly and cannot be switched off in our systems. You can set your browser to block these cookies, but some parts of the site may not work as intended. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. Examples include cookies that maintain your session state as you navigate through the site.</p>

                <p class="text-lg">Performance cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information anonymously. These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve site performance. They help us know which pages are most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our site.</p>

They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. They remember choices you make (such as your language preference or region) to provide a more personalized experience. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</p>

They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They work by uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. These cookies are typically persistent and remain on your device until they expire or you delete them.</p>

                <p class="text-lg">First-party cookies are set directly by our website when you visit us. These cookies are generally used to enable basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website. The information collected by these cookies is used exclusively by us and is not shared with third parties except as required by law.

                <p class="text-lg">Third-party cookies are set by domains other than our website, typically by our partners and service providers. These cookies are used for various purposes including analytics, advertising, and social media integration. For example, we may use Google Analytics cookies to understand how visitors use our site. These third parties have their own privacy policies and may use the information collected for their own purposes. We recommend reviewing their policies for more information.</p>

                <p class="text-lg">Cookies can remain on your device for different periods of time. Session cookies are temporary and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device until they expire or you delete them. The lifespan of persistent cookies varies - some may expire after a few days while others may remain for several years. We set expiration dates for our cookies based on their purpose, with security cookies typically having shorter lifespans than preference cookies.</p>

                <p class="text-lg">You can control and manage cookies in various ways. Most browsers allow you to refuse or accept cookies, delete specific cookies, or block cookies from particular sites. You can also set your browser to notify you when you receive a new cookie. However, blocking all cookies may affect website functionality. Our cookie consent tool allows you to manage your preferences for non-essential cookies. Remember that if you use multiple devices, you'll need to manage cookies on each one separately.</p>

Common options include the ability to delete existing cookies, block all cookies, or set preferences for different websites. The steps vary by browser - consult your browser's help documentation for specific instructions.

Currently, there is no industry standard for how to respond to DNT signals, and our website does not currently respond to them. Instead, we provide you with choices about the collection and use of your information as described in this policy. We continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology.</p>

These features may set cookies that recognize your IP address and the page you're visiting. Social media cookies allow you to share content and connect with social networks.

These tiny graphic images help us analyze user behavior by counting visitors or monitoring how users navigate our site.
